What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In project one, we explored the advantages and disadvantages of different data structures in order to determine which data structure would be most appropriate for organizing courses in an alphenumerical ordered list and searching for a specific course from that list. I determined that a binary search tree would be most approptiate for the program requirments. In project two, we applied what we learned from project one by writing the code for the program mentioned in project one, implementing the data strucutre that was determined to be most appropriate.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by first evaluating the requirments of the program. Then I evaluated the advantages and disadvanges of the different data structures. Each data structure can be more efficient than the others in some ways while being less efficient in other ways. It's important to make sure the data structure you use is the more efficient option for how you wish to interact with the data.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I overcame the roadblocks I faced by taking a step back and then returning to work with fresh eyes. Then, I would use the debugger to go through my code step by step to see how the data is transforming as it moves through the program and figure out where things went wrong.


How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Working on this projected has expanded my knowledge of data structures. In the future, I will use the data structure that is most appropriate for the program requirments rather than trying to make the data structure I am most familiar with work for the project regardless of if it is the most efficient.


How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

With these projects, I explored how to write more modular code. When possible, I tried to write code as seperate functions or classes that could be used for something similar rather than writing the majority of the code in main.
